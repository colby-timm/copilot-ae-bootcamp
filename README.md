Hey there! üëã

Mona here. I've prepared an exciting AI coding journey for you! Each session provides a clean, isolated environment where you can learn GitHub Copilot skills without worrying about setup or dependencies. üíö

**How it works**: Click a session button below to create a dedicated branch with all the files and instructions you need. Each session is independent and starts with a known, clean state! üöÄ
